# Implementatin of sorting algorithms in Bash

## Why this project exists

I created this repository to demonstrate my skill in bash scripting and knowledge of algorithms

## What you will find in this repository

You can find here implementation of different sorting algorithms, like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort etc.

### What is Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 

### What is Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain. 

## Implementation

Every sorting algorithm is implemented as a single script that takes list of parameters (numbers) and returns a sorted input list. You can find comments and fine named variables inside every script :)
